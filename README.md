# Number-Plate-Secognition-System
We will use the Python OpenCV library. It is an open-source library for machine learning and offers a common infrastructure for computer vision. We will also use Pytesseract for the project. Pytesseract is a Tesseract-OCR Engine to read images type and extract the details available in the image.
